A place for Muslims to recharge their faith

This website was created June-July 2020. The theme is garden like. The colors include: rgb(217, 250, 222)(The background. Light green) rgb(166,255,179)(The headers. grassy green) & rgb(247,237,181)(The Selection Bar. Light brown.)
There are flowers falling in the background. The background fades them so they are not disturbing. The content background is: rgba(217,250,222,0.9). The header was drawn by hand on the computer. The flower colors are red, white, and blue.
There are currently seven main parts: The Home page, The Videos Page, The Islamic History Page, The Daily Ayah Page, The daily reminder page, the Islamic Fun page, The Help The Ummah page, and the About us page.
