	    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Islamic Fun: What is halal and what isn't?</h3>
	    <p style="font-size:1vw; line-height: 200%; margin: 3%; text-align: left;">
		    In Islam fun is good. Laughing and smiling with our family and brothers and sisters in Islam is a very important part of us. Allah(SW) says in surat Yunus,
	    <div style= "text-align: right; margin: 1%">
		    يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم مَّوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَاءٌ لِّمَا فِي الصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ - 10:57
		    <br>
		    قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُوا هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ - 10:58
	    </div>
	    <div style="font-size:1vw; line-height: 200%; margin: 3%; text-align: left;>
		    O humanity! Indeed, there has come to you a warning from your Lord, a cure for what is in the chests[i.e. the heart], a guide, and a mercy for the believers. Say, “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is far better than whatever [wealth] they amass.
		    <br>
		    This shows us that Islam and the mercy that Allah(SW) must make us happy and smile. As Dr. Nabilsi says, "If you are a true believer you should know that there is no one on earth that is happier than you exept for those who fear Allah(SW) more than you."
		    <br>
		    The enjoyment that haram brings you is momentary and usually followed by waves of regret. So when we have fun we can't lie, cheat, gamble, do haram things. However we can play together(even in the masjid:), joke without lying together, and have fun that doesn't involve haram.
		    <br>
		    Though it is hard you will expirience satisfaction and conentment when you strive to follow Allah. In fact the Prophet ﷺ said, "Allah, the Almighty, says: 'Whosoever does a good deed, will have (reward) ten times like it and I add more; and whosoever does an evil, will have the punishment like it or I will forgive (him); and whosoever approaches Me by one span, I will approach him by one cubit; and whosoever approaches Me by one cubit, I approach him by one fathom, and whosoever comes to Me walking, I go to him running; and whosoever meets Me with an earth-load of sins without associating anything with Me, I meet him with forgiveness like that."
		    <br>
		    In another hadith the prophet ﷺ says that "Allah(SW) says, 'Whoever draws nearer to me by a hand-span, I will draw closer to him an arm-span.'"
		    <br>
		    And when you get closer to Allah(SW) you will feel content, and the Prophet ﷺ even says, "Allah the Exalted has said: 'I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have made obligitory upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him."
		    <br>
		    All of that we can get make making ourselves a little better, and often we hurt others or lie when we joke. Peope often through in words like trashcan and dumbo(sometimes words even worse). So that is a good place to start improving ourselves.
		    <br>
		    May Allah(SW) help us get close to him and make us leaders and role models for ourselves, our families and the greater muslim ummah.
		    <br>
		    As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah my dear brothers and sisters!
