	<h1 id='sectionTitle'>Home</h1><p class='article'>As-salamu alaikum,<br>The Muslim Garden was made in June 2020. We have many resources to help you make an Islamic environment in your home and hopefully help change your heart for the better.<br> <br><strong>Our Goals</strong><br>We would like to give an Islamic environment to your home and community. We can help you do this by giving your kids Islamic games to play on, but also by showing you the way to build an Islamic environment in your community in a way that the next generation doesn’t get lost.<br>We would like to remind you that the environment outside the masjid or an Islamic school is much different than the environment of a public school and it is important that you use every resource available to keep your children firmly on the straight path.<br>We are dedicated to making sure that your kids and community are firm in their religion and we have many fun, but knowledge building programs that you can incorporate in your community's environment. <br><br><strong>How you can help</strong><br>        	We would appreciate your help a lot! But we are not in need of money. We would like to ask you for your time. Spending your time taking your kids to the masjid joining Quran reading sessions and helping them improve at reading while you are at home may not be easy. But if you do it for the sake of Allah it will become enjoyable. Especially if you are doing it with your friends. And then you will start seeing your work bringing you happiness in this life and the hereafter inshallah. <br>You and the people you help will become happy inshallah.
