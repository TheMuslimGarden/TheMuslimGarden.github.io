         <p class='article'>As-salamu Alaikum,
            <br>The Muslim Garden was made in June 2020. We have many resources to help you learn, have fun, and get
            some beneficial information.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Our Goals</strong>
            <br>We would like to provide you with information that can help you establish an Islamic environment at home
            and in your community. We are planning do this by giving you and your kids some fun Halal games to play, and
            by providing suggestions for some activities to build an Islamic environment for your children in your
            community, and giving you reminders to help you along your way. This is at most importance to protect the
            Muslim identity of the next generation, and protect them from getting lost.
            <br>We all know that the environment outside the Masjid or the Islamic school tends to drive kids away from
            their Islamic identity, therefore, it is important that we use every resource available to keep our children
            firmly on the straight path.
            <br>We are trying to be a small pillar to support achieve this goal having fun and enjoying the journey. Of
            course, to do this we will need your help.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>How you can help</strong>
            <br> Alhamdulillah, we are not in need of money, but we need you to dedicate some time and effort to support
            this cause. You can support by dedicating time to take your kids to the Masjid to join a Quran reading
            session, by helping them improve their Quran recitation at home, by establishing a fun program in an Islamic
            invironment for them seeking Allah's pleasure. We promise this will be very rewarding and enjoyable in this
            life and in the hereafter. Especially when you are doing it with your friends.
