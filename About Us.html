			<strong>Abdurrahman:</strong><br><br>As-salamu alaikum,<br><br>
			My name is Abdurrahman. I am 13 years old. I am interested in seerah, tafsir, and fiqh. I like seerah the
			most because I like stories and I like to read. I like tafsir because it helps you understand what you read
			and helps you uncover different meanings. And I like fiqh because it explains what you need to do to achieve
			your ultimate goal, the pleasure of Allah. May Allah help us all learn from the seerah. May he help us read
			the Quran and understand its tafsir, and may he help us follow the rules that Allah (SW) laid out for us in
			the fiqh. Ameen.<br><br>
			I also like sports. I especially like soccer, double touch football, and basketball. I like soccer because
			it has the most running and teamwork involved. Football because of the running, strategy and planning
			involved. And basketball because it is a mix of the two with some extra rules. May Allah (SW) help us stay
			fit and help us plan for our future. Ameen.<br><br>
			I hope you enjoy our website and enjoy using it!<br><br>
			As-salamu alaikum!</p>

			<strong>Omar:</strong><br><br>
			As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh,<br><br>
			My name is Omar and I am 12 years old. I am interested in seerah, tafsir, and fiqh. I like the seerah
			because it teaches us the lifestyle of the Prophet Muhammad ï·º, and I like tafseer because it shows the deep
			meaning of the ayah you are reading, and I like fiqh because it explains the laws that you follow. <br><br>
			Some of my hobbies are sports like soccer and basketball, and I also like coding. I coded a lot of this
			website and Abdurrahman also helped. My favorite page of this site is the Help The Ummah page. Make sure to
			visit it! I hope you like this website! If you have any suggestions, place them <a
				href="https://themuslimgarden.github.io/index#feedback ">here.</a> <br><br>
			Thanks for visiting the website! As-Salamu Alaikum!</p>
