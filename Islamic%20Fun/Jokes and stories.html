			Wife: Have you ever seen me in your dream?<br><br>

		<h3 style="color: #0084ff; text-align: center;">The Imam's news</h3>
		<p style="margin: 3%; font-size: 1vw; line-height: 200%">Here is the story of an Imam who got up after Friday
			prayers and announced to the people:"I have good news and bad news. The good news is, we have enough money
			to pay for our new building program. The bad news is, it's still out there in your pockets."</p>
		<h3 style="color: #0084ff; text-align: center;">The Imam's Horse</h3>
		<p style="margin: 3%; font-size: 1vw; line-height: 200%">An Imam was selling his horse in the market. An
			interested buyer came to him and requested if he could get a test drive. The Imam told the man that this
			horse is unique. In order to make it walk, you have to say Subhanallah. To make it run, you have to say
			Alhamdulillah and to make it stop, you have to say Allahu Akbar. The man sat on the horse and said
			Subhanallah. The horse started to walk. Then he said Alhamdulillah and it started to run. He kept saying
			Alhamdulillah and the horse started running faster and faster. All of a sudden the man noticed that the
			horse is running towards the edge of the hill that he was riding on. Being overly fearful, he forgot how to
			stop the horse. He kept saying all these words out of confusion. When the horse was just near the edge, he
			remembered Allahu Akbar and said it out loud. The horse stopped just one step away from the edge. The man
			took a deep breath, looked up towards the sky and said Alhamdulillah!</p>
		<h3 style="color: #0084ff; text-align: center;">The Old Lady and the Atheist</h3>
		<p style="margin: 3%; font-size: 1vw; line-height: 200%">An elderly lady was well-known for her Iman and for her
			confidence in talking about it. She would stand in front of her house and say Alhamdulilah "Allah be
			praised" to all those who passed by. Next door to her lived an atheist who would get so angry at her
			proclamations he would shout, "There ain't no Lord!!" Hard times came upon the elderly lady, and she prayed
			for Allah to send her some assistance. She would pray out loud in her night prayer" Oh Allah! I need food!!
			I am having a hard time, please Lord, PLEASE LORD, SEND ME SOME GROCERIES!!" The atheist happened to hear
			her as she was praying, and decided to play a prank on her. The next morning the lady went out on her porch
			and noted a large bag of groceries and shouted, "Alhamdulilah, Allah be praised!." The neighbor jumped from
			behind a bush and said, "Aha! I told you there was no Lord. I bought those groceries, God didn't." The lady
			started jumping up and down and clapping her hands and said, "ALHAMDULILAH WA SHUKRILLAH‚Äù. He not only sent
			me groceries, but he made the <i>her</i> pay for them!"</p>
