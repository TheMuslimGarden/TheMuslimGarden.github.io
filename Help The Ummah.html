        <p>As-salamu alaikum,<br> We appreciate that you have come here. Here are some ways you can help your community
            and hopefully the Muslim ummah. We would like to remind you that these projects are Sadaqah Jariyah and
            hopefully will give you lots of reward. If some of these projects seem too large for you, you can do them
            with your friends. May Allah increase your reward.<br>As-salamu Alaikum wa rahmatu Allah<br><br><strong>
                Start your own branch of Al-Huda Quran school</strong><br>This is a great way to encourage kids to
            memorize Quran. At the same time, it brings them to the masjid too! Every weekend (e.x. Saturday after Fajr
            or Sunday before Asr) kids come. They memorize and review surahs. Each surah has a certain amount of points
            earned and the kids can use the points to buy things once a month. You can keep track of the surahs using
            cards. Each time they recite a surah to you can mark it. They can repeat a surah once a month so that they
            review it and don’t forget it. They can memorize for two hours or so. Each time you can give them
            lunch/breakfast (depending on what time you do it). Then you can let them play till their parents come and
            pick them up.<br><br>
            <!--See how it was done in Greenville, SC.--><br><br><strong>Saturday/Sunday Sports</strong><br> Every
            weekend get together, pray, read a hadith, translate it, and play sports. If a field (like in a park) is
            available you can play soccer/football. If a basketball court is available you can play basketball. For the
            kids it is fun, and they learn as well.<br><br>
            <!--See how it was done in Greenville, SC.--><br><br><strong>Sunday/Saturday Halaqah</strong><br> Ever
            realize how hard it is to go to Fajr sometimes. But coffee is a good encouragement. And for kids’ desserts
            are. So how about making a Halqua after Fajr and then going to Panera, Dunkin Donuts, ect. Sounds fun right?
            Pray Fajr, then have everyone who joins reads some quran, prays 2 rakat of Duha, and then goes
            somewhere(like to a donut shop). Fun right?!<br><br>
