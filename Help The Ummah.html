	<h1 id='sectionTitle'>Help the Ummah</h1><p>As-salamu alaikum,<br>        	We appreciate that you have come here. Here are some ways you can help your community and hopefully the Muslim ummah. We would like to remind you that these projects are Sadaqah Jariyah and hopefully will give you lots of reward. If some of these projects seem too large for you, you can do them with your friends. May Allah increase your reward.<br>As-salamu Alaikum wa rahmatu Allah<br><br><strong> Start your own branch of Al-Huda Quran school</strong><br>This is a great way to encourage kids to memorize Quran. At the same time, it brings them to the masjid too! Every weekend (e.x. Saturday after Fajr or Sunday before Asr) kids come. They memorize and review surahs. Each surah has a certain amount of points earned and the kids can use the points to buy things once a month. You can keep track of the surahs using cards. Each time they recite a surah to you can mark it. They can repeat a surah once a month so that they review it and don’t forget it. They can memorize for two hours or so. Each time you can give them lunch/breakfast (depending on what time you do it). Then you can let them play till their parents come and pick them up.<br><br><!--See how it was done in Greenville, SC.--><br><br><strong>Saturday/Sunday Sports</strong><br>        	Every weekend get together, pray, read a hadith, translate it, and play sports. If a field (like in a park) is available you can play soccer/football. If a basketball court is available you can play basketball. For the kids it is fun, and they learn as well.<br><br><!--See how it was done in Greenville, SC.--><br><br><strong>Sunday/Saturday Halaqah</strong><br>        	Ever realize how hard it is to go to Fajr sometimes. But coffee is a good encouragement. And for kids’ desserts are. So how about making a Halqua after Fajr and then going to Panera, Dunkin Donuts, ect. Sounds fun right? Pray Fajr, then have everyone who joins reads some quran, prays 2 rakat of Duha, and then goes somewhere(like to a donut shop). Fun right?!<br><br><!--See how it was done in Greenville, SC--></p>
