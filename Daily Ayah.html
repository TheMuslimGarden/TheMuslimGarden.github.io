	Assalamu alaikum Wa Rahmato Allah Wa barakato:<br><br>
<div style="text-align:right;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</div><br><div style= "margin-left: 2%;">
Today we will talk about why it is important to say بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم at the beginning of
every action we do.<br>
First let us go over the meaning of Bismillah:
Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem is translated as in the name of Allah the most gracious
most merciful. But what does that mean. It means that I am starting this action with the
help of Allah the most merciful, seeking his mercy and help in it. When I am starting an
action with the name of Allah SW, it means I am bringing the blessings of Allah SW to
accompany me with the results of this action, and this means that the benefits from this
action will be multiplied and the harmful things will be taken away.
Allah SW says at the end of Surat Ar-Rahman,<br><br>
<div style="text-align:right;"> تبارك اسم ربك ذي الجلال والإكرام </div><br>
Blessed is the Name of your Lord, full of Majesty and Honor.
From this verse we can understand that the name of Allah SW is blessed, so
mentioning the name of Allah SW brings his blessing.
We have few examples in the Quran where other prophets of Allah SW used to say
Bismillah. For example Prophet Nuh Alaihi Assalam when he went on to the ship:
Allah told us in Surat Hood:<br><br>

<div style="text-align:right;"> وقال اركبوا فيها بسم الله مجراها ومرساها إن ربي لغفور رحيم</div><br>
And he said (meaning prophet Nuh PBUH), “Board it! In the Name of Allah it will sail
and cast anchor. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”<br>
And when prophet Soliman sent the letter to Balqis he started the letter with Bismillah
Arrahman Arrahim:<br>
Allah says in Surat An-Aml:<br>

<div style="text-align:right;">إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - 27:30
  ألا تعلوا علي وأتوني مسلمين</div><br>
It is from Solomon, and it reads: ‘In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most
Merciful.<br>
Do not be arrogant with me, but come to me, fully submitting ˹to Allah˺.’”<br><br>

If we also look carefully at the first verse revealed to our prophet SAW we see Allah SW
asking prophet Mohammad SAW to read with the name of his lord (Allah SW). Allah
Says in Surat Al-Alaq:<br><br>

<div style="text-align:right;"> اقرأ باسم ربك الذي خلق</div><br>

Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created<br>
We need Allah’s Support with every action we do, and this why it is important for us to
get the habit of Saying Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem when we start any important
action.<br>
Here are few actions that the prophet SAW told us about the benefits of saying
Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem before we do them:<br>
1- In the morning and in the evening:<br><br>

<div style="text-align:right;">وعن عثمان بن عفان رضي الله عنه قال‏:‏ قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم‏:‏ ‏ &quot;‏ما من عبد يقول في صباح كل يوم
ومساء كل ليلة‏:‏ بسم الله الذي لا يضر مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السماء وهو السميع العليم، ثلاث مرات، إلا لم
يضره شيء‏&quot;‏‏.‏ رواه أبو داود والترمذي وقال حديث حسن صحيح ‏.‏</div> <br>

&#39;Uthman bin &#39;Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, &quot;He who recites three times every morning and
evening: &#39;Bismillahil-ladhi la yadurru ma&#39;as-mihi shai&#39;un fil-ardi wa la fis-sama&#39;i, wa
Huwas-Sami&#39;ul-&#39;Alim (In the Name of Allah with Whose Name there is protection against
every kind of harm in the earth or in the heaven, and He is the All-Hearing and All-
Knowing),&#39; nothing will harm him.&quot;
[Abu Dawud and At- Tirmidhi].<br><br>

2- When going out of the house:<br><br>
<div style="text-align:right;">عن أنس رضي الله عنه قال‏:‏ قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏:‏ ‏&quot;‏من قال-يعني إذا خرج من بيته-‏:‏ بسم الله توكلت
على الله، ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله ، يقال له‏:‏ هديت وكفيت ووقيت، وتنحى عنه الشيطان‏‏ ‏&quot;‏فيقول ‏:‏-يعني الشيطان-
لشيطان آخر‏:‏ كيف لك برجل قد هدي وكفي ووقيّ ‏؟</div><br>
<br>
Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, &quot;Whoever says (upon leaving his house): &#39;Bismillah,
tawakkaltu &#39;alallah, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah [I begin with the Name of
Allah; I trust in Allah; there is no altering of conditions but by the Power of Allah],&#39;
it will be said to him: &#39;You are guided, defended and protected.&#39; The devil will go far
away from him&quot;.<br>
&quot;One devil will say to another: &#39;How can you deal with a man who has been guided,
defended and protected?&quot;.<br>
If you say this dua you will be guided, protected, and defended.<br><br>

3- When entering the home and before eating:<br>
<div style="text-align:right;">وعن جابر، رضى الله عنه قال‏:‏ سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول‏:‏ ‏ &quot;‏إذا دخل الرجل بيته، فذكر الله تعالى عند
دخوله وعند طعامه، قال الشيطان لأصحابه‏:‏ لا مبيت لكم ولا عشاء، وإذا دخل ، فلم يذكر الله تعالى عند دخوله، قال
الشيطان‏:‏ أدركتم المبيت؛ وإذا لم يذكر الله تعالى عند طعامه قال‏:‏ أدركتم المبيت والعشاء‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏</div>
<br><br>
Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
I heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying, &quot;If a person mentions the Name of Allah upon
entering his house or eating, Satan says, addressing his followers: &#39;You will find
nowhere to spend the night and no dinner.&#39; But if he enters without mentioning the
Name of Allah, Satan says (to his followers); &#39;You have found (a place) to spend the
night in, and if he does not mention the Name of Allah at the time of eating, Satan says:
&#39;You have found (a place) to spend the night in as well as food.&quot;&#39;
[Muslim].<br>
<br>
This hadeeth tells us to say Basmalah before we eat and enter the house so the
shaytan may not be among us.<br>
Here is a funny story that I came across when I was preparing for this.<br>
It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:<br>
“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was eating food with six of his Companions when a
Bedouin came and ate it all in two bites. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘If he had
said Bismillah, it would have sufficed you (all). When any one of you eats food, let him

say Bismillah, and if he forgets to say Bismillah at the beginning, let him say Bismillah fi
awwalihi wa akhirih (In the Name of Allah at the beginning and at the end).’”<br><br>

When you say Basmalah, the bounty of Allah is increased. And if we forget to say it in
the beginning we say Bismillah fiawwalihi wa akhirih<br><br>

To conclude we can get the support of Allah and attain his blessings by simply
remembering to say Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem every time we do any activity, and
especially when we do an important activity such as studying, doing a test, buying,
selling, or working.<br>
We ask Allah SW to help us be among those who remember him always and help us
remembering to mention his name before every action we do.
