        <div style='text-align:center;'><strong>Daily Reminder 1: Understanding Your Salah</strong><br>By: Abdurrahman
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 2%">As-salamu alaikum,<br>Today we would like to remind you of one of the biggest steps
            you can take towards khushoo’ and that is understanding your salah. Because salah is an ever going
            conversation with Allah(SW). <br>In Fact surah Al-fatihah and Al-tahiat are dua’s in themselves and the
            messenger ﷺ told us in part of a hadith narrated by Abu-hurairah, 'Indeed Allah(SW) does not accept a duaa’
            from a distracted heart.' Thus, we must know what we are saying in our salah to get maximum benefit.<br>I
            ask Allah(SW) to help us all get the maximum benefit from our salah. Ameen.<br>Below are the meanings of
            surat Al-fatihah, surat Al-Ikhlas, surat Al-Nas, and surat Al-Falaq.<br><br>Al-Fatihah:<ol>
                <li>In the name of Allah the most gracious(most gracious), the most merciful. 1:1</li>
                <li>All praise is for Allah the lord of the worlds, 1:2</li>
                <li>The most gracious, most merciful, 1:3</li>
                <li>The owner of the day of recompense. 1:4</li>
                <li>You we worship and you we seek help from; 1:5</li>
                <li>Guide us to the straight path. 1:6</li>
                <li>The path of those you have sent your blessings upon, not of those who have earned you anger or the
                    misguided. 1:7</li>
            </ol><br>Al-Ikhlas:<ol>
                <li>Say, 'He is Allah, the One, 112:1</li>
                <li>Allah, the Eternal Refuge. 112:2</li>
                <li>He doesn’t give birth nor is he born. 112:3</li>
                <li>And there is not for him an equivalent.' 112:4</li>
            </ol>Al-Falaq:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak, 113:1</li>
                <li>From the evils he created, 113:2</li>
                <li>And from the evil of darkness when it settles, 113:3</li>
                <li>And from the evil of those who blow in the knots(magicians), 113:4</li>
                <li>And from the evil of an envier when he envies.' 113:5</li>
            </ol>Al-Nas<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Say, 'I seek refuge with the lord of the people, 114:1</li>
                <li>The king of the people, 114:2</li>
                <li>The god of the people, 114:3</li>
                <li>From the evil of the retreating whisperer, 114:4</li>
                <li>The one who whispers into the chest of the people (Satan), 114:5</li>
                <li>From the jinn and the people.' 114:6</li>
            </ol><br>May Allah reward you for reading this. As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah.
