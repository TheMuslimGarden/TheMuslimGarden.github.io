<div style=text-align:center;><strong>Seerah 3: Islam in secrecy</strong><br>
Written by: Abdurrahman<br>
Edited by: Omar<br><br>
As-salamu alaikum,<br><br>
	As many of you know, the Prophet ﷺ spent three years calling in secrecy. But not as many people know where his base of operations was. It was in the house of Al-Arquam bin Al-Arqam.The Prophet ﷺ used to gather with his companions and teach them in the house of Al-Arquam. The Prophet ﷺ used to order his companions to be careful and not spead islam till Allah(SW) commanded that. And when they needed to pray they went to certain areas, hid in it, and prayed away from the view of Quraish. One time while they were praying a group from Quraish got close to them. They laughed at the muslims and asked them what they were doing. And the muslims kept praying. And the men from Quraish attacked them, and the muslims who were praying had to defend themselves. So Sa’d(PBUH) hit one of the attackers with a bone and cut him. And that was the first time the muslims and mushriks fought together<br><br>
	And in a narration the Prophet ﷺ and his companions split up when Asr time came. One or two people would pray in each place. And two of them prayed in one place and two men from the mushrikeen of Quraish attacked them saying bad words. So the two muslims threw stones at them, and the two mushriks ran away. So those two mushriks went to Abu-Jahl, Abu-Lahab, and Ukbah bin Abu-Ma’t, and told them what they saw. So in the morning they went, and the muslims were coming out before dawn, making their wudus’ and praying. So the mushriks attacked, and hit the muslims, hurt them and the muslims protected themselves. And after words the Prophet ﷺ was ordered to publicly announce islam.<br><br>
