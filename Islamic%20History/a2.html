<div style=text-align:center;><strong>Seerah 2: Family warning<br></strong>
By: Abdurrahman Housari</div>
As-salamu alaikum,<br><br>
At The age of 40 the Prophet ﷺ received prophethood. The very man whose own people called, “The Truthful, The Trustworthy,” had received his first divine message. He warned his best friend, his wife, his adopted son, and his cousin and they all believed. After a couple of days, he had received more revelations including one that said, “Warn your close family.” 26:214. <br><br>
At that point the Prophet ﷺ gathered 40 or 45 of his relatives including his uncles and cousins. They were all big people who ate and drank a lot. Some of them would eat a small lamb alone. The Prophet ﷺ got only a lamb leg. They ate until they were full and the lamb leg still looked untouched. He got a small bowl(cup) of milk and they drank their fill and their bowl(cup) was still full. Then the Prophet ﷺ told them about what happened to him and how he had been chosen to become a prophet. But before he could continue Abu Lahab who was an evil hearted man said, “Oh Muhamad these are your uncles and your cousins, leave your disbelief (In the idols), and know that your people have no power against all the Arabs, it is better for your people to stop you, because if you continue with what you are on, it is easier for you (to have us stop you) than to have the branches of Quraish stop you with the help of the Arabs.” Then he said, “I haven’t heard of a man who brought his father's family with worse than what you have brought us for.” Then he insulted the Prophet ﷺ and talked bad about his what the Prophet ﷺ said and the Prophet ﷺ didn’t speak at all. Then everyone left. <br><br>
The Prophet ﷺ gathered them again and got the same food as the first time and the same thing happened. Then before anyone spoke he said, “Praise be to Allah(God), I praise him and I ask for his help, and I believe in him and I rely on him, and I witness that there is no god but Allah alone, there is no partner for him.” Then he said, “Indeed the good person doesn’t lie to his relatives, and by Allah if I lied to all the people, I wouldn’t lie to you, and if I deceived all the people, I wouldn’t deceive you.”<br><br>
He continued, “By Allah the only god, I am the messenger of Allah specifically to you and to all the people, you will die just as you sleep, and you will be resurrected like you wake up, and you will be judged according to what you do, you will be rewarded good for your good (actions), and you will be rewarded bad for your bad (actions). It is either paradise forever, or fire forever. Oh, sons of Abdul-Mutalib, I do not know of a man who brought his people with better than what I brought you. I have brought you with the goodness of this life and the after-life. And indeed, Allah the all-mighty ordered me to call you to him. So who among you pledges to me to be my brother and friend.”<br><br>
So, his uncle Abu-Talib said, “How beloved to us is helping you, and accepting your advice, and strong is our belief that what you say is true and these are the family of your father and I am exactly like them, except that I am the fastest to let you do what you like, so go do what you were ordered, for by Allah I will not stop protecting you except my soul will not allow me part with  the religion of Abdul-Mutalib.” Then everyone spoke in agreement except for Abu-Lahab.<br><br>

As soon as Abu-Lahab heard that his face had changed and he spoke, “Oh sons of Abdul-Mutalib! By Allah it is the worst. By Allah it is the worst! Stop him before others (the Arabs and the rest of Quraish) stop him; Because if you surrender him you would be humiliated (you would look weak)! And if you protect him you would be killed!”<br><br>
So the aunt of the Prophet ﷺ spoke to Abu-Talib, “Oh my brother, is it ok for you to see the son of your brother be accused/humiliated! For by Allah the scholars(of Cristianity and Judiasim) kept saying that from the descendants of Abdul-Mutalib would come a prophet and that (the only person fit to be a prophet) is him(Muhammad ﷺ).”<br><br>
So, Abu-Talib responded, “By Allah we will protect him as long as we live.” Then everyone left and the Prophet ﷺ knew that Abu-Talib would be an ally and a support for him in his call to Islam, and that Abu-Lahab would be an opposer and enemy for him in his call to Islam.<br><br>
<strong>Lessons Learned</strong><br><br>

<li> We should take care of our family and keep them on the straight path.</li>
<li> It is important that we Find allies to help us in doing good.</li>
<li> We must do good because we will die, be resurrected, and be judged.</li>
<li> Islam brings goodness in this life and the after-life, and encorages only good actions, not killing, terrorism, and fighting for no reason.</li>
<li> When you are doing a good action you will always have an opposer (someone who wants to stop you.</li></ol> <br>
