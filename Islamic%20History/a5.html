        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Seerah 5: Quraish’s reaction to the call</h2>
        <p>When Muhamamad ﷺ openly began da’wah, and declared the truth his people neither distanced themselves from
            him, nor did they answer his call. It stayed like that till he openly declared their idol gods false, and in
            their view shamed their gods, and declared the way of their ancestors false. When that happened they
            couldn’t take it. How dare he, they thought and began openly rejecting and fighting the message of islam.
            Except for the few muslims and the Prophet’s ﷺ loyal uncle Abu-Talib who protected him and supported
            him.<br><br>
            And so the Prophet ﷺ continued his call following the orders of his lord. Showing them the wrong that is in
            shirk(associating with Allah) and telling them to leave it. And making it clear for them that the gods that
            they are insisting on worshiping don’t benefit them nor hurt them in any way, in fact they have absolutely
            no effect on anything at all. He made it clear that whoever worships those stones is in clear
            misguidance.<br><br>
            Meanwhile, while Quraish fought back Abu-Talib kept putting his foot down, stopping them from doing anything
            to harm the Prophet ﷺ. Quraish tried to reason with Abu-Talib but he wouldn’t agree with them and remained
            firm on protecting his nephew. However, after lots of stubbornness from Quraish they reached an agreement.

        <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></p>
        <ol>

            <li> People will be okay with what you are saying until it conflicts with their interests.
            <li> Don’t be blinded like Quraish from seeing the wrong ways of your actions.
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p>May Allah(SW) guide us, and help us follow his orders like we should follow them. <span
