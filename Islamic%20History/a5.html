	<h1 id='sectionTitle'>Seerah #5</h1><h2 style="text-align:center;">Seerah 5: Quraish’s reaction to the call</h2>
	<p>When Muhamamad ﷺ openly began da’wah, and declared the truth his people neither distanced themselves from him, nor did they answer his call. It stayed like that till he openly declared their idol gods false, and in their view shamed their gods, and declared the way of their ancestors false. When that happened they couldn’t take it. How dare he, they thought and began openly rejecting and fighting the message of islam. Except for the few muslims and the Prophet’s ﷺ loyal uncle Abu-Talib who protected him and supported him.<br><br>
	And so the Prophet ﷺ continued his call following the orders of his lord. Showing them the wrong that is in shirk(associating with Allah) and telling them to leave it. And making it clear for them that the gods that they are insisting on worshiping don’t benefit them nor hurt them in any way, in fact they have absolutely no effect on anything at all. He made it clear that whoever worships those stones is in clear misguidance.<br><br>
	Meanwhile, while Quraish fought back Abu-Talib kept putting his foot down, stopping them from doing anything to harm the Prophet ﷺ. Quraish tried to reason with Abu-Talib but he wouldn’t agree with them and remained firm on protecting his nephew. However, after lots of stubbornness from Quraish they reached an agreement. See more about this agreement <a href= "a6"> Here</a>.<br><br> </p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></p>
<ol>

<li> People will be okay with what you are saying until it conflicts with their interests.
<li> Don’t be blinded like Quraish from seeing the wrong ways of your actions.
</ol>
<br><br> 
<p>May Allah(SW) guide us, and help us follow his orders like we should follow them. <span style= "color:green;"><i>Ameen</i></span><br><br>
