	<h1 id='sectionTitle'>Seerah #4</h1><div style= text-align:center;><strong>Seerah 4: Calling on the mountain of Safa</strong><br>
By: Abdurrahman</div><br>
	After the Prophet ﷺ was assured that Abu-Talib was on his side in the family meeting he started thinking of ways he could tell people about the message of his lord. <br><br>
So the Prophet ﷺ got up on the mountain of Safa and called, “Oh people come this morning.”and he called all the branches(tribes) of Quraish, “Oh sons of Fahr! Oh sons of A’di!” And so on until the person who couldn’t come would send an informant to see what was happening. When they got there he called them to Allah and warned them of his punishment so he said, “If I told you that there are horses in the valley that want to attack you would you believe me.”<br><br>
They said, “Yes, we have not seen from you except for truthfulness.”<br><br>
So he said, “I am a warner for you of a severe punishment.”<br><br>
So Abu Lahab said, “May you be miserable for the rest of the day. Is this what you gathered us for?”<br><br>
And so the ayah was brought down,<br><br><div style="text-align:right;">
تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ - 111:1
</div><br>May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he (himself) perish!<br><br>
Then in another narration the Prophet ﷺ said, “Free yourselves! I cannot benefit you, (when you are) in front of Allah (with)  anything. Oh descendants of Abd-Manaf (the Prophet's ﷺ great-great grandfather), I cannot benefit you in front of Allah (SW) anything. Oh Abas bin Abd-Almutalib (His uncle), I cannot benefit you in front of Allah (SW) anything. Oh Safiah the aunt of the Prophet of Allah, I cannot benefit you in front of Allah (SW) anything. Oh Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad! Ask me whatever you want of my money, (however) I do not benefit you in front of Allah anything!”<br><br>
<strong>Lessons learned</strong><ol>
<li>Sometimes it takes courage to follow the orders of Allah</li>
<li>Stopping someone from following the orders of Allah (SW) can lead to hellfire (May Allah protect us)</li>
<li>On the day of judgment only our belief and actions can help us</li>
<li>Quraish said they would believe an that an army was behind the mountain if the Prophet ﷺ said so. But they didn’t believe him when he said the truth! This shows us that arrogance alone can destroy our hereafter.</li></ol>
