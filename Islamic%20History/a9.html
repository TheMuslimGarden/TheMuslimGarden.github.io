	<div style="text-align:center;"><strong>Seerah 9: Lessons to the Prophet ﷺ and Islam’s growth</strong><br>
By: Abdurrahman Housari</div>
	As you can imagine the Prophet ﷺ continually persisted on teaching Islam to the leaders of Quraish so that Islam could grow stronger. One day while talking with some of the leaders an old man came and tapped the Prophet ﷺ. The Prophet ﷺ frowned and turned his back on the old man and continued talking to Quraish’s leaders. So Allah(SW) admonishes the the Prophet ﷺ in the first 10 verses of Abasa,<br><div class="Arabic">
عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ - 80:1 أَن جَاءَهُ الْأَعْمَىٰ - 80:2
	</div>Till…<div class="Arabic">
وَهُوَ يَخْشَىٰ - 80:9 فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّىٰ - 80:10
</div><br>He frowned and turned away. Because there came to him the blind man, [interrupting]. You never know [O Prophet], perhaps he may be purified, or he may be mindful, benefitting from the reminder. As for the one who does not care (about faith); to him you give attention; even though you are not to blame if he would not be purified. But as to him who came to you running. While he fears [ Allah ], you were inattentive to him.<br><br>
	These 10 ayat were a reminder for the Prophet ﷺ and for ourselves today. We should respect everyone and treat them equally. However, to Quraish this was an attack on them, because they realised that no man would make himself look bad in something that he writes with his own hands, and may be passed down for generations! To them this was an attack because people realized, they believed and all Quraish could do was discourage, torture, and kill.<br><br>
What they had just begun to realize was boggling their minds. How could people be so willing to be tortured and killed for something that didn’t get them money or power, or any material benefit? And after these ayas the Prophet ﷺ became more dedicated to the weaker muslims and islam started to spread among the weak and poor.Because though in this life they had little chance to enjoy, they knew they had the eternity of paradise to themselves. They knew that they were right. And they had Allah and his Prophet ﷺ supporting them! They knew they would win, and indeed they did! May Allah enter us and them into Jannah together to the highest level. Ameen.<br><br>
As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatullah
