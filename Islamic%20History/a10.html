        <div class="center"><strong>Seerah 10: Quraish’s techniques to attack the Prophet ﷺ</strong><br>By: Abdurrahman
            Housari</div><br>
        When Quraish saw that the Prophet ﷺ wasn’t stopping and could not be convinced by Abu-Talib nor the whole of
        Quraish or anything else in the world they began to use different techniques to fight the Prophet ﷺ.<br><br>
        It was narrated that two of the daughters of the Prophet ﷺ, Ruqyah(PBUH) and Umm-Kulthum(PBUH), were married to
        two of the sons of Abu Lahab. So Abu-Lahab forced his sons to divorce them and Utaybah did. Then they walked to
        Abu-Alaas and told him to devorce his wife Zainab(PBUH), another of the Prophet ﷺ’s daughters. They told him
        that he could have any woman from Quraish. He said even though he was a mushrik, “By Allah it wouldn’t happen! I
        wouldn’t devorce my wife! And I wouldn’t like for my wife to be any woman from Quraish!” Therefore the Prophet ﷺ
        used to talk well about his son in law Abu-Alaas, a man from Quraish married to Ruqayah. And then they went to
        Utbah once again and told him to devorce his wife Ruqayyah(PBUH) and they would give him any woman in Quraish.
        He told them who he wanted to marry and they married him to her and he divorced her.<br><br>
        It was said that when Utaybah divorced Umm-Kulthum(PBUH) he came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, “You disbelieved in
        your religion, and you separated your daughter.” Then he grabbed the Prophet ﷺ’s shirt and ripped it. So the
        Prophet ﷺ said, “As for me, I ask Allah to punish you with his dogs(animals).”<br><br>
        So when he went on a business trip in Syria, he stayed in a place in Syria called Al-Zarqua’. At night a lion
        began to go around their camp, so Utaybah began to say, “Oh my! He is by god going to eat me like Abu-Kabshah
        (Muhammad ﷺ) prayed to happen to me! Abu-Kabshah (Muhammad ﷺ) killed me while he is in Makkah and I am in
        Syria.” And then the lion picked him out at night from between the people and bit him a huge bite and killed
        him.<br><br>
        And in a narration before Utaybah when out his father Abu-Lahab told him, “Oh my son, I cannot guarantee that
        Muhammad ﷺ won’t pray against you.” So when the lion went around them that night in Syria Abu-Lahab put his son
        in the middle of the group, then they slept. So he went around smelling them till he reached Utaybah and grabbed
        him in the head and ate him. So Abu-Lahab said, “By Allah I knew he wouldn’t escape the prayer of Muhammad (ﷺ)”
        <br> <br>
        Another one of their techniques was that they would create rumors that the Quran didn’t come from Allah(SW), and
        they threw rumors about the personality of the Prophet ﷺ, and other rumors so that the public couldn’t think
        deeply about the things the Prophet ﷺ talked about. Only the rumors. So they used to say that a man is teaching
        this to him. And they said it is the stories of the past so it is told to him in the morning and evening. And
        they said that this is only a lie that he made up, and another tribe is helping him. And they would say, “What
        is wrong with this messenger, eating food and walking in the markets?”<br><br>
        Another one of their techniques was to make fun of and to belie the Prophet ﷺ. They would say, “Oh, you who the
        Quran was sent to your crazy!” And they would say things like, “This is a lying magician!” That way since there
        were many of them and few followers they could create so many stories that it would be hard to believe that all
        of them were false.<br><br>
        However the Prophet ﷺ was patient and therefore Allah(SW) would still light the hearts of the people. Every day
        the muslims were growing and Quraish was running out of options and though they were becoming harsher and
        harsher the muslims were becoming more and more steadfast.<br><br>
        May Allah(SW) guide us and keep us on the right path. Ameen.<br><br>
        As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah
