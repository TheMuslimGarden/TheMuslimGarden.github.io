        <div style=" text-align:center"><strong>Seerah 7: Quraish begins to torture the Muslims</strong><br>
            By: Omar</div><br>

        When the Quraish realized that they could not harm the Prophet (SAW), they turned their anger towards the weak
        of Makkah that became Muslims. Those were the slaves, the poor, and those with no family to defend them. Each
        tribe turned against its Muslims and began beating them and torturing them. <br><br>
        For example when Bilal became a Muslim, he was a slave at the time. His owner, Umayah, began torturing him so
        much. Abu Bakr soon came and bought him from Umayah and freed him. <br><br>
        Another example would be Al-Yasir. When they accepted Islam, Quraish began torturing them and killed Sumayah,
        Ammar ibn Yasir’s mother. Later his father also died of the torture. <br><br>
        There was also Al-kabab bin Al-Arat who’s uncle wrapped him in a burning mat when he realized that he was a
        muslim!<br><br>
        When even members of rich families accepted Islam their families would torture them. This happened to Mus’ab ibn
        Umair. He used to be given so much by his family. It was said that you could smell the perfume he was wearing
        before you even saw him. When he heard about Islam, he accepted it. When his family found out, they took
        everything away from him and locked him in his room. He was later able to escape and migrate in the first
        migration to Abyssinia.<br><br>
        Most of the Muslims that Quraish tortured did not renounce their faith. May Allah have mercy on them and on us,
        and strengthen our faith. <br><br>
        As-Salamu Alaikum.
