		<div style="text-align:center;"><strong>Seerah 1: The first revelation</strong><br>
			By: Abdurrahman Housari</div><br>
		As-salamu alaikum,<br><br>
		The first revelation was the beginning of the 23-year long struggle of Muhammad ﷺ who ultimately changed the
		lives of billions. In Arabia where the people worshiped idols, drank, gambled, and did adultery, lived a man who
		was pure, protected by God himself. This was a man who was known by his people and his family as truthful,
		trustworthy, and pure. He never worshipped an idol in his life. Then when he was 40, things began to change. He
		spent time in the caves of Makkah when Muhammad ﷺ went to worship the one god and think about the mistakes of
		his people. Worshiping idols to “get closer to god,” as his people said. But it was wrong so sometimes for
		nights he would go and ponder. <br><br>
		One day Jibreel came in, in the form of a man, and said, “Read!” and squeezed Muhammad ﷺ.<br><br>
		Muhammad ﷺ replied, “I don’t know how to read.”<br><br>
		The man repeated, “Read!” and squeezed Muhammad ﷺ harder.<br><br>
		Muhammad ﷺ replied, “I don’t know how to read.”<br><br>
		Then he squeezed him even harder and there and then the first 5 verses of the Quran were revealed. “Read in the
		name of your lord who created. He created the human from a clot of blood. Read in the name of your lord the most
		generous. The one who taught with the pen. He taught the human what he did not know.”<br><br>
		The Prophet ﷺ ran home and asked his wife to cover him. He explained what happened and his wife consoled him by
		telling him that he was a good man, he helped the poor, took care of the needy, had good manners, and was
		truthful. She took him to her cousin who studied the previous books (the torah and the bible). He told Muhammad
		ﷺ that the man saw was the angel jibreel (gabriel), the same angel that came to Moses and Jesus before
		him.<br><br>
		As you can imagine the Prophet ﷺ was shocked. He didn’t know who he would become, or how or why. But he knew he
		had a mission; a mission to change the lives of the misguided people of Arabia and the world, and bring them
		light. Even if it cost him everything.<br><br>
		Thank you for reading this. As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah.
