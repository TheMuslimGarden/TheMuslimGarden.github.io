    <div style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Seerah 1: The first revelation</strong><br>
By: Abdurrahman Housari</div>
As-salamu alaikum,<br><br>
        	The first revelation, the beginning of a 23-year long struggle of one man who ultimately changed the lives of billions. It all started in cave outside Makkah when Muhammad ﷺ when to think about the mistakes of his people. Worshiping idols to “get closer to god,” as his people said. But it was wrong so sometimes for nights he would go and ponder. <br>
One day Jibreel came in, in the form of a man, and said, “Read!” and squeezed Muhammad ﷺ.<br><br>
Muhammad ﷺ replied, “I don’t know how to read.”<br><br>
The man repeated, “Read!” and squeezed Muhammad ﷺ harder.<br><br>
Muhammad ﷺ replied, “I don’t know how to read.”<br><br>
Then he squeezed him even harder and there and then the first 5 verses of the quran were revealed. “Read in the name of your lord who created. He created the human from a clot of blood. Read in the name of your lord the most generous. The one who taught with the pen. He taught the human what he did not know.”<br>
The Prophet ﷺ ran home and asked his wife to cover him. He explained what happened and his wife consoled him by telling him that he was a good man, he helped the poor, took care of the needy, had good manners, and was truthful. She took him to her cousin who studied the previous books (the torah and the bible). He told Muhammad ﷺ that the message he got was the same message that Mosas and Jesus received before him.<br>
That was the beginning of the 23-year struggle of the prophet Muhammad ﷺ. May Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon him.<br><br>
Thank you for reading. As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allahi wa barakatuhu.<br>
