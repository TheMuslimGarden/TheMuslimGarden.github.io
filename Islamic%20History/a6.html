    <div style="text-align:center;"><strong>Seerah 6: Quraish threatens Abu Talib</strong><br>
      By:Omar</div><br>
    The Quraysh were starting to get fed up with the Prophet ﷺ’s dawah. They went to Abu Talib and threatened him. They
    said: “Abu Talib! Your nephew has cursed our gods and criticized our religion and ridiculed our customs and called
    our fathers mis-guided. Either leave him to us or there will be a split between us and you. You have the same
    religion and creed as we do.” Abu Talib spoke to them and they left. When he did not do anything they came back and
    threatened him again. They said: “Abu Talib! You have age, honour, and position among us. We had hoped that you
    would stop your Nephew, but you have not done so. By Allah, we cannot endure any longer this cursing of our fathers
    and ridiculing of our customs and criticism of our idols. Let us have him or we will put him and you in such a
    position that one or other of us will be destroyed.”<br><br>
    When Abu Talib was threatened by his people multiple times, so he went to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and asked him:
    “Nephew, your people (Quraish) have come to me with threats. Spare me and yourself and do not burden me with more
    than I can bear.”<br><br>
    The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ replied: “Uncle, by Allah, if they were to place the sun in my right hand, and the moon in my
    left hand on condition that I abandon this business, I would still not leave it until Allah makes it victorious or I
    die doing it.”<br><br>
    The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ turned around to leave when Abu Talib called: “Turn round, Nephew!” The Prophet ﷺ turned
    around towards him. Abu Talib then said: “Nephew, go and say whatever you like. By Allah, I will never surrender you
    to any one.”<br><br>
    The Prophet ﷺ continued his da’wah with the support of Abu Talib. <br><br>
