    <div style="text-align:center"><strong>Seerah 8: Quraish Attack the Prophet ﷺ and Abu-Bakr</strong><br>
By:Abdurrahman</div><br>
	<p>When the Quraish saw that the muslims couldn’t be persuaded to turn back they started accusing the Prophet ﷺ of being a poet, a sorcerer, a fortune teller, and a crazy person. They started talking to him rudely, ignoring him, and even attacked him.<br><br>
	Quraish also attacked Abu-Bakr Al-Sideeq(PBUH). One time when he called them to Islam they beat him till his cheeks couldn’t be distinguished from his nose! He was unconscious and his tribe, Banu-Taim carried him home thinking that he was going to die. When he woke up he immediately asked about the Prophet ﷺ. When it was safe he went to the Prophet ﷺ and the Prophet ﷺ made dua’ for him and his mother. He was hurt many other times! Once he told them when they attacked the Prophet ﷺ, “Would you kill a man just for saying: My lord is Allah?” When they saw him they beat him, pulled out his hair, and pulled him by his beard!<br><br>
	This was the loyalty of Abu-Bakr(PBUH). May Allah(SW) reward him and everyone who strived for the sake of Allah(SW). Ameen.<br><br>
As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah</p>
